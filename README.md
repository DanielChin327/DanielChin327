#### Learning Journey
Growing up in the Rocky Mountain area, my fascination with international studies always drove me to seek out and connect people worldwide. Coding became a bridge for me. A versatile skill that transcends borders and cultures, allowing me to engage with diverse individuals everywhere. Beyond the global connection it offers, I am drawn to coding for the challenge and satisfaction it brings. The process of building something from scratch, navigating through complex problems, and eventually unraveling solutions fuels my passion for continuous learning and development in this ever-evolving field.
